##A knight(a,b) may move on an nxn grid by moving a spaces horizontally and b spaces vertically or b spaces horizontally and a spaces vertically. In other words, a knight(a,b) located at a space in the grid (x,y) may move to a space (x±a,y±b) or (x±b,y±a). To answer the following questions, you will need to determine the shortest path a knight(a,b) may take from space (0,0) in the upper-left corner to space (n−1,n−1) in the lower-right corner on an nxn grid.¶
